hi, i'm hotcocoaNcode. i don't know why i chose that username but i don't hate it and here we are now. <br> <br>
i mainly use Java/C++, and i have a weird obsession for messing around in different graphics APIs. <br>
generally i am unskilled (why do people keep thinking i'm smart it's weird). sometimes i do music things too.
